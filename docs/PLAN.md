# Architecture and status

Cagara is a typed functional language that compiles queries to SQL. The
prelude is written in Cagara; Rust supplies the relational primitives, type
checker, evaluator, language server, and SQL backend.

## Pipeline

```text
source -> syntax/AST -> type checker -> relational IR -> schema validation
        -> SQL lowering -> dialect rewrite -> SQL
```

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `cagara-syntax` | Lexer, lossless parser, AST, formatter |
| `cagara-hir` | Modules, name resolution, HM rows, evaluator, IR, validation |
| `cagara-sql` | SQL lowering, templates, dialect-specific intrinsics |
| `cagara-lsp` | Diagnostics, hover, definitions, references, symbols, completion |
| `cagara-cli` | `cagara` executable and CLI integration |
| `editors/vscode` / `editors/nvim` | Editor clients for `cagara lsp` |

## Current behavior

- Top-level definitions are generalized; lambda parameters are monomorphic.
- Rows are ordered and kinded. `merge`, `keyMap`, and `mapValue` are reduced
  in the checker and share schema rules with IR validation. See
  [`ROW-TYPES.md`](ROW-TYPES.md).
- Query stages are deferred constraints, so helpers can be reused with
  different rows. Aggregates and windows have explicit phases and cannot be
  placed where SQL would reject them.
- `select` replaces a row; `update` merges computed fields over it. Outer joins
  use `mapValue (AsNullable)` for the nullable side.
- SQL is built as ANSI and rewritten across supported dialects. See
  [`SQL-DIALECTS.md`](SQL-DIALECTS.md).
- `cagara lsp` and both editor clients use one workspace model with unsaved
  buffer overlays.

## Known gaps

- Pipelines are capped at 10 stages and expressions at 192 levels to keep
  compiler and language-server stacks bounded.
- Some join combinations require extra derived tables because parenthesized
  joins are not yet represented directly.
- `--optimize` is opt-in; it runs sqlglot optimization after Cagara lowering.
- A few loader, template qualification, reserved-word, and deep-recursion edge
  cases remain documented in the issue tracker and tests.

Run `cargo test --workspace` and `cargo check --workspace` before changing
shared type or lowering rules. The worked report in `examples/report.cagara` is
also exercised against SQLite and DuckDB in CI.
